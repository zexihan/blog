Hi, I am Zexi Han, a grad student pursuing M.S. in Data Science at Northeastern University. I'm seeking full-time opportunities of software engineer or data scientist.

I can speak English, Mandarin and Japanese (still learning...). I love traveling and enjoy communicating with local people. Dream of being a voyager and travelling around the world! And here is my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bloomingliam/) to follow!

In terms of specialization, I made efforts to gain an insight into various machine learning algorithms and have a keen interest in applying them to real-world scenarios bringing convenience to people's life. I am also interested in building web or mobile applications employing various tech stacks, which is full of fun!

Before coming to the US, I got the Degree of Bachelor of Science (Engineering) with First Class Honors in Telecommunications Engineering with Management from the Joint Program between BUPT and QMUL. My undergraduate final project during my internship in CASIA was elected as the BUPT Outstanding Final Project.

Professional interestsï¼šData Science, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Nature Language Processing, Parallel Computing, Web Development.
